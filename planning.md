### Technologies Used

| Term | How | Why |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Variables** | To store values such as colors and font families | Because they allow us to reuse their values without copying them over and over again and void dealing with hex values. In case of changing their values is a lot easier than going through a whole css file |
| **Color Functions** | To apply color variations | It can make the stylesheet easier to read and present more flexible interfaces, providing many arguments without becoming difficult to call. |
| **Nesting** | It allows to nest CSS selector and help to compartmentalizing elements | To avoid the repetition of parent selectors and make complex CSS layouts width a lot of nesting much simpler |
| **Mixins** | To group our repetitive code | To keep cleaner code |
| **Placeholders** | Placeholders works like an #id or .class expect the # and . are replaced with %. They are used with the @extend directive | To include styles that multiple element share |
| **Media Queries** | To apply different styles based on the screen size | To make the website responsive across different screen sizes |
| **Using Math operators** | To create a relative sizing elements across different design and screen sizes | To avoid figuring out the ratio of each screen size |
| **Loops** | To repeatedly output a set of styles. For example, the grid layout. | To avoid a repetitive set of rules. |
| **Folder Structure** | To organize the partials in our stylesheet | To easily locate components and layout sections. |
| **@import partials** | To import SCSS files and compile them into one CSS file. | It eliminates the need to link multiple http requests for styling. |
| **Parentheses** | To affect the order of operations. | To include them in math operators. |
